Slide 2
-------
After kicking the idea around at LGM2014, the main site was built and (soft) launched in August, 2014.
The forums (Discuss) were finally launched April, 2015.

Since Discuss was launched just over a year ago, it has gained 475 active users.

Several Free Software projects use Discuss as their official forums: G'MIC, RawTherapee, PhotoFlow, and Filmulator.

* The traffic graph shows pageviews by week.
* The first small spike by G'MIC is when they moved their forums to discuss.
* The second (very big) spike is when RawTherapee moved their forums over (it's the large spike near the last "E" in "RawTherapee".
