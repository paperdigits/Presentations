## Slide 1
PIXLS.US
A community for tutorials, workflows, and showcasing high-quality photography using Free/Open Source tools.

## Slide 2
This past year I (Pat David) have been busy designing and building PIXLS.US from scratch.
The blog is up and running and the first few tutorials are already available.
A discourse forum has been implemented to support the community as well as act as a comment stream on posts (discuss.pixls.us).

Coming in the near-term, more content (tutorials and artist showcases) and community-building (on the forums).

## Slide 3
Soft launch will continue and all are encouraged to visit and participate!
